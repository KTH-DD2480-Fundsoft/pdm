# Report for assignment 4

## Project

**Name:** PDM

**URL:** https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm

A package manager for python projects.

## Onboarding experience

We continued with the project we worked on in assignment 3. Below is our onboarding experience from the project report for assignment 3.

The project has a good CONTRIBUTING.md, where clear instructions are given
on how to organize ones contribution. The project recomends using it's own 
product (PDM) to ensure formatting and linting and to document changes in 
a specific `news` directory. There is nothing wrong with the CONTRIBUTING 
file, but there is a lack of documentation of certain modules and the code 
in general. The instructions and documentation for running and using the 
product are very good and the product works as intended. 

**How easily can you build the project? Briefly describe if everything worked as documented or not:**

- **a) Did you have to install a lot of additional tools to build the software?**

    No we only needed to install PDM, and it handled the rest for us.

- **b) Were those tools well documented?**

    PDM itself is well documented on the user side.

- **c) Were other components installed automatically by the build script?**

    PDM automatically installs all the necessary dependencies.

- **d) Did the build conclude automatically without errors?**

    Yes, this is very well handled by PDM.

- **e) How well do examples and tests run on your system(s)?**

    It runs excellently. With single scripts `pdm test` and `pdm coverage`, the tests and test coverage is executed with `pytest`.

For setting up tools and libraries (step 4), enumerate all dependencies
you took care of and where you spent your time, if that time exceeds
30 minutes.
